The Anvil Repair is an essential addon for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, designed for players who want to preserve resources and streamline their gameplay experience. Inspired by popular utility mods from the Java Edition, this addon allows players to restore the durability of anvils using iron ingots, making it an efficient alternative to crafting new anvils from scratch.

In the Java Edition, players have long enjoyed mods that provide the ability to repair anvils with iron ingots, effectively extending their lifespan and saving valuable resources. This addon brings that much-needed functionality to the Bedrock Edition, allowing you to restore anvil states and reduce the need for crafting new anvils. Whether you're an experienced player or new to Minecraft, this addon is a practical addition to your toolkit, ensuring that your anvils last longer and your iron reserves are better managed.

The addon offers configurability through the script directory, allowing you to specify the number of iron ingots required to repair an anvil. This ensures that the restoration process aligns with your preferred gameplay balance.

This addon is ideal for players who value resource efficiency and want to maintain their anvils without the constant need to craft new ones. With this addon, you can keep your anvils in good condition using a customizable number of iron ingots, thereby reducing the overall consumption of materials in your game. Itâ€™s perfect for both survival players who want to extend the lifespan of their tools and enjoy a more sustainable Minecraft experience.
